# Chinese stories in pinyin

This folder contains transcriptions of Chinese (Mandarin) translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) in [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

## Conventions

Some capitalization and punctuation may be included (on an experimental basis) to improve readability. Automatically converted texts may not be grouped but rather presented one syllable/character at a time. The format will be standardized over time.

The text follows the paragraphing and layout of the original story to facilitate creation of parallel readers with Chinese text and pinyin presented together.
