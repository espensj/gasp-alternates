# Norwegian stories in IPA transcription

This folder contains IPA transcriptions of Norwegian translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp).

## Conventions

No non-IPA punctuation, capitalization or diacritics are included (e.g. commas, question marks, full stops, accent marks etc.).

The text follows the paragraphing and layout of the original story to facilitate creation of parallel readers with Norwegian text and IPA presented together.
