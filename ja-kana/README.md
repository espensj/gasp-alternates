# Japanese stories in Kana transcription

This folder contains Japanese translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) in Kana-only transcription (i.e. with no Kanji included, as in the style of many children's books).

## Conventions

All kanji have been replaced with their corresponding pronunciations written in kana.

The text follows the paragraphing and layout of the original story to facilitate creation of parallel readers with Japanese text in Kana+Kanji and Kana-only presented together.
