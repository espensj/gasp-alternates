# Punjabi stories in Shahmukhi script

This folder contains Punjabi translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) in [Shahmukhi script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahmukhi_alphabet).

## Conventions

The Punjabi translations in the main repo are in [Gurmukhi script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurmukhi_alphabet). The same text is presented here, but written in Shahmukhi instead.

The text follows the paragraphing and layout of the original story to facilitate creation of parallel readers with Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi text together.
